The challenge: Compression. Our latest kata is based on basic image compression techniques using run-length encoding (RLE)

# The challenge: Compression
Our latest kata comes to us courtesy of Lee Fuller from the MAP (Metadata, Audiences and Publishing) team and is based on basic image compression techniques using run-length encoding (RLE).

RLE can be used as a simple way to compress image data by specifying the number of times consecutive pixels repeat themselves, with the aim of reducing the total number of bits used to represent the original image.

There are three challenges increasing in complexity: run-length encoding a mono image; a greyscale image; and finally using lossy compression.

Lee has put together a mini-site that explains the challenge, has a great explainer video and contains some sample images. Full details here: https://broxy.tools.bbc.co.uk/broxy-kata/

Feel free to make any assumptions and be creative in the intepretation of this kata. For example, you might like to have a go at rendering the image as part of your solution and testing.
